    <h1>The Human Cost of Conflict</h1>
    <div class="section-left">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The issue of terrorist groups in the Philippines goes beyond news headlines and affects real people deeply. It matters to society because it impacts many lives, including those who join these groups and those harmed by them. Groups like the Abu Sayyaf Group and the CPP/NPA are driven by chaos, creating a loop of poverty and violence (Brey, 2023). We need to focus on the individuals behind the numbers to understand this better.</p>

        <h2>The Human Element</h2>
        <p>The human side becomes clear when we look at why people join these groups. For some, it’s a decision made out of few choices. In areas like Sultan Kudarat and Sulu, where money and education are scarce, the promise of a better life can be tempting. Some join due to lack of schooling and growth, not just extreme beliefs (Brey, 2023). Civilians suffer too, facing kidnapping and abuse, losing their families and safety in the process.</p>
